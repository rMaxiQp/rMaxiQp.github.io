## Tl;DR

A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers that provide fast delivery of assets.

---

A CDN enables the quick transfer of Internet assets including HTML pages, Javascript files, Stylesheets, etc. Also, a properly configured CDN can help protect websites against some common malicious attacks, e.g. Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks.

A CDN does not host the actual web content, it caches content at the network edge to improve performance. Also, caching reduces hosting bandwidth to improve security.

**Benefits of using a CDN:**

- Shorter loading times
  - Global distributed nature of a CDN means reduce distance between users and website sources.
  - A CDN is optimized for load balancing and better read performance
  - Smaller file size using minification and file compression methods
  - TLS/SSL certificates connection reuse and TLS false start enabled
- Less bandwidth costs
  - Result is cached
  - Reduce routing distance from/to server
- Better content availability and redundancy
  - Load balancing distributes network traffic to multiple servers
  - Intelligent failover ensures less downtime
- Better website security
  - TLS/SSL certificates enabled
  - Load balancer protects server from DDOS
